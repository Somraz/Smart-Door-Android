# Smart-Door-Android
This is the Android Application that I built as a part of my project Facial Recognition Smart Door Application. We introduced a feature in the software wherein if the user is not Whitelisted, the door can be unlocked for the guests remotely using this android application which communicates to the Raspberry Pi via Microsoft Azure IoT-Hub.
